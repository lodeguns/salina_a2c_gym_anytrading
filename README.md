# Facebook Salina - Gym_AnyTrading
Slight modification to one of the Facebook Salina examples, to test the A2C algorithm on financial series.


The gym FOREX data are provided by gym_anytrading library [GitHub Page](https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading)

I take no responsibility for the use of the code.
It is a simple test of SALINA's potential for financial problems.
